# safkalista-backend

This is the backend for "Safkalista" - an app that allows you to create your own weeks menu. 

## Database
The database uses flyway migrations. Add your database configuration to
 resources/default.edn such that both flyway and queries can access the
  db. 
 
 You can add your own database or use a test database with docker-compose
 , see /scripts/docker:
 
  ```
      $ docker-compose up db
      
  ```
  
 There is test data in afterMigration.sql
 to get you started. 
 
 To clean the database
 ```
     $ lein dbclean
     
 ```

 To run migrations
 ```
     $ lein dbmigrate
     
 ```
